Bone Marrow Transplant Classification: Predicting Outcomes in Children

Overview

This project investigates the use of machine learning to predict the success or failure of bone marrow transplants in children. It leverages the Bone Marrow Transplant Children dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The code explores various classification algorithms to identify the most effective model for this task.

Data Acquisition

The code employs the ucimlrepo library to fetch the Bone Marrow Transplant Children dataset, containing information on patient and donor characteristics alongside transplant outcomes.

Data Exploration and Preprocessing

Missing Value Handling: The code identifies and addresses missing values in features using appropriate strategies (e.g., mean/median imputation, removal for features with a high percentage of missingness).
Univariate Analysis: Categorical feature distributions are visualized using pie charts (e.g., Recipientage10 - recipient's age category). Count plots highlight the distribution of categorical features across target variable classes.
Bivariate Analysis: A heatmap is generated to explore potential correlations between numerical features.
Feature Selection and Engineering: The code might involve feature selection based on domain knowledge or feature importance analysis (not shown here). Categorical features like Disease are likely one-hot encoded for machine learning algorithms.

Machine Learning Modeling

Train-Test Split: The data is strategically split into training and testing sets to ensure unbiased model evaluation. The testing set should be a representative sample of the real-world data distribution.
Model Training and Evaluation:
    The code trains several classification algorithms like:
        Logistic Regression
        K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
        Support Vector Machines (SVM)
        Naive Bayes (consider including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for further exploration)
    Hyperparameter tuning for each model is essential to optimize performance but not necessary . Exploration of different hyperparameter values to find the best configuration is crucial.
    The models are evaluated on the testing set using accuracy and potentially other metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC (for imbalanced classes). Confusion matrices can be generated to visualize performance for imbalanced classes.

Future Work

Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation techniques to obtain a more robust estimate of model generalizability and avoid overfitting.
Feature Engineering: Explore feature engineering techniques like dimensionality reduction (e.g., Principal Component Analysis) or feature creation (e.g., interaction terms) to potentially enhance model performance.
Interpretability: Analyze feature importances to identify the most critical features for understanding model decision-making.

Additional Considerations

Imbalanced Classes: If the dataset has imbalanced classes (e.g., more successful transplants than failures), consider using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., F1-score, AUC-ROC) and potentially employ techniques like oversampling or undersampling to balance the class distribution.
Model Explainability: Investigate techniques like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) or SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for deeper insights into model predictions.
